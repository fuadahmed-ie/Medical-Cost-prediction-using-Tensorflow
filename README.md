# Project Name: Medical Cost Analysis and Regression with TensorFlow

## Introduction

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression modeling of medical costs using machine learning techniques. By leveraging features such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, we aim to develop accurate predictive models to estimate medical costs. This analysis can help insurance companies and healthcare providers in cost management and pricing strategies.
